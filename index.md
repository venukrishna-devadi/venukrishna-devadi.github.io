# Venu Devadi
### AI/ML Enthusiast

I’m a GenAI Engineer specializing in building production-grade AI systems that combine large language models, retrieval, and reasoning to solve real enterprise problems. My work focuses on taking messy, unstructured data — documents, logs, customer journeys, and knowledge bases — and turning it into reliable, explainable, and usable AI-powered workflows.

Currently, I work at Verizon, where I design and deploy LLM-powered platforms for test automation, customer journey intelligence, and semantic knowledge retrieval. These systems are used by QA teams, customer support, and product leaders to automate complex workflows, reduce manual effort, and make better decisions from large volumes of data.

I specialize in:
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using embedding models, FAISS, and OpenSearch
	•	Agentic AI workflows for multi-step reasoning and task orchestration
	•	Prompt & context engineering for grounded, low-hallucination outputs
	•	Document and knowledge extraction from PDFs, Jira, logs, and APIs
	•	Production ML systems built with Python, FastAPI, Docker, and cloud infrastructure

Before Verizon, I built my foundation in machine learning, NLP, and data systems through research and applied projects — including transformer-based NLP models, vision transformers, and multilingual translation systems. I also hold a Master’s in Data Science, where I focused on deep learning, NLP, and real-world ML deployment.

What drives me is applied AI — not just models in notebooks, but AI systems that people actually use. I care deeply about reliability, evaluation, and explainability, especially when AI is embedded into business-critical workflows.

I’m always interested in working on problems at the intersection of LLMs, retrieval, reasoning, and real-world data, whether that’s in legal tech, customer support, enterprise automation, or product intelligence.
