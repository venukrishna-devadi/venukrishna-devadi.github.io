# Venu Devadi
### AI/ML Enthusiast

Hello! I am a Graduate Student in Data Science from Saint Peter‚Äôs University. While my coursework primarily focuses on Data Science, my true passion lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in Large Language Models (LLMs). My professional journey began as a Transaction Analyst at Amazon, followed by roles at Google and other organizations. However, I struggled to find work that truly sparked my curiosity. It was during the COVID-19 lockdown that I discovered my interest in Data Science. Through self-study, I delved deeper into the field, which eventually led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Data Science.

During my graduate studies, my fascination with Transformers and Advanced NLP grew, especially after exploring [Mohit Iyyer‚Äôs](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~miyyer/) Advanced NLP sessions. His work inspired me to dive deeper into LLMs, their architectures, and real-world applications. Currently, I am actively researching Natural Language Processing, focusing on the inner workings of Neural Language Models and their advancements. My goal is to deepen my expertise and contribute to the evolving field of NLP and AI.


## üéì Education
- Master of Science (MS) - Data Science (Sep 2022 - Feb 2025)

## üèÜ Projects  

### **Custom Multilingual Language Translator using Transformer** [code](https://github.com/venukrishna-devadi/Multilingual-Transformer-Model-for-Language-Translation)
- Developed a **custom Transformer-based model** for **English-to-Hindi & English-to-Telugu** translation.  
- Designed **BERT-based custom tokenization** and trained the model using **PyTorch** with language-specific tokens.  
- Optimized inference using **top-k sampling** for real-time multilingual translation.

### **Image Classification on Anime Characters** [code](https://github.com/venukrishna-devadi/IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-PROJECT-ON-ANIME-CHARACTERS)
- Built a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** from scratch using PyTorch, achieving **24% test accuracy**.  
- Fine-tuned **ViT_B_16_Weights** on a custom **Dragon Ball Z dataset**, boosting test accuracy to **85%**.  

### **COVID Tweet Classification using BERT** [code](https://github.com/venukrishna-devadi/BERT-cvoid-tweet-classification)  
- Designed an [**NLP model**]() using **BERT embeddings** to classify COVID-19 tweets.  
- Achieved **94.18% accuracy**, **85.73 F1-score**, and enhanced generalization with **AUC: 84.78%**.

### **Multilingual Machine Translation using MBart-50** [code](https://github.com/venukrishna-devadi/Multilingual-Translation-with-MBart-50)
- Fine-tuned **MBart-50** for **English-to-Telugu & English-to-Hindi** translation.  
- Achieved **BLEU Score: 26.88**, **Perplexity: 1.3047**, with over **50k bilingual sentence pairs**.  

### **COVID Twitter Multi-Label Classification** [code](https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-Twitter-Classification)  
- Built a **Multi-Label Classification Model** to categorize **COVID-19-related tweets** into **public health themes** using models like **BERT, CNN-GRU, and TCN**, achieving **high accuracy (94.19%)** and **F1-score (98.35%)** for **non-stratified classification**.  
- Improved and evaluated performance with simpler methods like **TF-IDF with SVM** and compared them to advanced models like **COVID-Twitter-BERT**, effectively handling **class imbalance** with **stratified classification** (**F1: 85.73, Recall: 90.39%**).

### **SONI - Machine Learning Chatbot** [code](https://github.com/yourusername/SONI-Chatbot)  
- Built an **NLP-powered chatbot** trained on **926 user patterns** using **transformer-based embeddings** (**BERT, 768-d vectors**).  
- Evaluated multiple models (**SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree**) achieving **best accuracy: 48% (KNN)** and **F1-score: 39% (Logistic Regression)**. - Designed for **API integration & deployment**, with future scope for **reinforcement learning enhancements**.
